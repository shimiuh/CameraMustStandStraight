Hi,

GlassesOn is using the camera in order to analyze all our eye exams and almost every sensor

on the phone.

While we can support a lot of possible phone angles we recommend the users to stand up,

straighten their arm and keep the phone at eye level. I hope that this demonstration by Woody

will to understand the problem :)

In order to help the user understand that he is doing something wrong we

would like to distort the content of phone in the opposite angle to the phone,

and to do this in all angles unless the phone is straight.

In this exercise you will need to work with the front camera and some

sensors.

1. This app will uses the front camera and display it to the user.

2. Rotate the image in the opposite angle to the tilt (2D)

3. Distort the image up and down on x movment (3D)

4. Take a picture button  will only be clickable if the angle is

right.

5. When “take” a picture button is available will store in the app directory.
